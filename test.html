          Wow... This distribution is definitely not a distribution that
          I have been using in the past.  It contains: wayland, pipewire, an
          an immutable os and OpenRc and more.<br><br>

          The topics that I will cover will be
          <ol>
            <li>How to update the systems</li>
            <li>How to install software</li>
            <li>How to install different window managers</li>
            <li>If the program is in the immutable OS then is fulfilled dependency</li>
            <li>and Even more</li>
          </ol>

                                    Usually, only use 3 partitions ( UEFI, "/" and swap ) are used for a linux install
                                    ( ex. Nitrux OS).  The result was no changes could be made to OS since it was
                                    immutable OS and the whole partition was immutable.
